## Welcome to the Wildfire and Water Security Project GitHub

This organization contains GitHub repositories or "repos" associated with the Wildfire and Water Security Project. 

### Project Overview 
Changing climates and increasing warm and dry conditions are increasing the frequency of large, high-severity wildfires across the Western United States. Wildfire prone forested watersheds supply water to approximately 60–70 percent of the US population. When these watersheds burn there is increased potential for floods, erosion, landslides, and introduction of contaminants to streams andrivers, which can impact downstream community infrastructure, drinking water treatment, public health, and aquatic ecosystem health. The effects from wildfires on water supplies can persist for
decades, resulting in hidden costs to communities estimated to be 30-times greater than the reported suppression costs (approximately $4 billion in 2020). To understand these impacts, research is being conducted to understand how communities might be better prepared to maintain reliable, high quality drinking water. 

The desired outcome of this research is to support community preparedness to maintain safe drinking water in the aftermath of wildfire. We are developing critical scientific knowledge to inform related policy and management decisions as wildfire continues to become more prevalent across the Pacific Northwest.

### The Team 
The research team is comprised of an interdisciplinary team of 60+ scientists. With 25+ federal, state, and local partners collaborating with the project.


### Finding a Repository 
Repositories should be named in the form **WWS**-**Node#**-**ProjectCode**-**ProjectKeywords** where:
-   **\#** is the node number
-   **ProjectCode** is a short (\<5 letter) acronym for the project
-   **ProjectKeywords** describe what the project is about in a few words
